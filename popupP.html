      <h3>Bad Skincare Products for Teens:</h3>
      <p>- Products with harsh chemicals: Avoid products containing phthalates,
         parabens, PFAS, artificial dyes, formaldehyde, and sodium lauryl sulfate, as they
          can disrupt hormones and cause skin irritation.
      </p>
      <p>- Exfoliating scrubs: Can be too harsh for teen skin, causing micro-tears and irritation.
      </p>
      <p>- Products with vitamin C: May not be suitable for acne-prone skin 
        and can cause irritation when combined with other acids or retinol.
      </p>
      <p>- Retinol products: Can be irritating, especially for 
        sensitive skin, and increase sun sensitivity.
      </p>
      <p>- Anti-aging products: Not necessary for teens, as they can cause irritation and 
        are often marketed with unrealistic expectations</p>
